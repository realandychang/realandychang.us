<h1 class="ac-center">Chapter 1</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't remember anything when I woke up. Today is just another day of losing memory. This weird situation started two weeks ago, but I didn't care so much about it. In modern times, people will always forget things every day due to the convenience of technology. But, nothing could stop me from thinking about it when the class is boring. As usual, after a short amount of time, I fall asleep like lightning. I am pretty sure if the hourly worker didn't call me, I wouldn't wake up till the next morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I woke up, she said to me that I have been sleeping here the whole day, and the school is going to close soon. After that, I suddenly woke up and looked at my watch, and my head became much clearer. It is 9 PM right now. I am asking myself, "What am I doing here?" But it couldn't help me remember it. I got no choice but to ask her what to do.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hospital wing is still open for you to use," She said, with a cold voice that made me feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice made me remember some of my memories from the past. The voice is so familiar to me, and I could hear the voice echoing in my head. While I am thinking, she disturbed me and took me back to reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I realized I have been sitting here for a long time, I thanked her for reminding me and helping me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran away immediately because of that voice and did not notice where I am going. Suddenly I ran into something, but I can't feel any pain.   When I opened my eyes, I saw I am in a house that I never been to before, and the unfamiliar environment made me feel more uncomfortable than talking with the hourly worker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, I saw the girl looking at me with a weird-looking. Her eyes were all white with no eye-ball could found or seen. The looking at her frightened me so much. I tried to run away from her, but she said something that terrified me so much. Soon, I went back to reality and feeling exhausted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day when I woke up, everyone on the second floor gathered around me and looking at me like I am the clown in the circus. Maybe my life and I are just a joke. Everything seems to be peaceful until the second period has ended. The hourly worker has come and said something to me that took me back to the terrifying mood for the whole day.</p>
