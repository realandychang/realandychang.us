<h1 class="ac-center">Chapter 3</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the gun firing sound, I felt exhausted. I soon fell asleep as the stranger carried me.
I knew in my head that he was nice to me. If he tried to kill me, he should already. When I woke up, I was on a helicopter. I saw an adult-looking man next to me. He has a pair of big and shiny eyes with short eyebrows. He has no wrinkle on his face, and his hair was neat. In the year 2086, it was perfect looking.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that I was looking at him, so he started talking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You remember those troops?" He said. "They were from the D.T Market."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't understand why they were trying to kill me?" I said with a puzzled looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I already talked to my members, and they will do the investigation process." He replied with a smile, the world's warmest smile ever!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you so much! May I ask what your name is?" I asked him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Marlon Andrus, a college student." He replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought for a moment and realized that the richest man in the world was called Alfie Andrus. So I decided to ask him. "May I ask that are you the son of Alfie Andrus?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I am. Did that make you uncomfortable? I'm so sorry." He said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry! It's just interesting that I am next to the billionaire's son." I said with the calmest voice possible. "Well, it's not weird that you have a helicopter."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I asked him the question, I relaxed. I can't imagine what it will be if Marlon didn't come and save me. I would be dead for sure. While I was thinking, a helicopter came into sight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! There's a helicopter outside!" I yelled at him with a scared voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are aiming for you!" He said. "You need to hide under the seat, quick!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't hesitate, and I shouldn't. Soon, I heard a huge explosion sound. Then, I don't hear other helicopters' sound. I got out of the tiny space under the helicopter and asked him what happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look over there." He said and pointed to an ocean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just an ocean and a mountain." I said. "But they should build a bridge for people to go across."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smart idea! But there was a bridge." He said. "It's also a famous bridge."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, the Golden Gate Bridge?" I said. This was something unbelievable for sure. I took out my phone and searched up the news, and it was true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was D.T Market who did it. I could tell by the helicopter that was next to us an hour ago. This event created the opportunity for the government to remove and ban the D.T Market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2075, the government and D.T Market signed a contract. On the contract, it has a term called removal term. Under this term, the government can not remove or ban the D.T Market unless it interferes with others' or public property. So, this is definitely an opportunity for the government to ban D.T Market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got back to Los Angeles, it was 8 PM already. I skipped all the classes that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're home now!" He said. "You will need to be careful since those people already got your data."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will!" I said thankfully. "Thank you so much!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem!" He said. "Before you go, could you tell me your number?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure!" I said. "I will drone it to you when I got home."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sounds good! Be careful!" He said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will! Thanks a lot!" I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2067, an application called "Drone it!" has been created. The function of this application was to deliver a real-life object to others. When I got home, I ran straight to my computer and droned a piece of paper with my phone number on it and a box of chocolate as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minute later, I received a letter in an envelope. It has nothing on the envelope, but I still opened it. I thought it was from Marlon, and he forgot to write something on the envelope. But it wasn't.</p>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dear Emmett Rhodes,</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>We hope you had a nice shopping experience at the D.T Market. We sincerely apologize for the situation that happened today at the D.T Market. We knew that we should not beg for your forgiveness, but we will compensate you by giving you a million dollars as your compensation.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>As an exchange, you shall not tell any reporter about the situation. We knew that you could be worrying about other people in the market that day, but we already used our technology to remove their memory about the thing that happened.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>If you do not want the compensation and report it to the reporter, please drone this letter back to D.T Street No.2, San Rafael, CA 94901, USA.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>We strongly recommend you accept the compensation and shut your mouth. Otherwise, we will send a helicopter and destroys your house.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>We hope you have a wonderful day!</i></p>

<p><i>Sincerely,</i></p>
<p><i>D.T Market US Department</i></p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put the letter into the "Drone It!" app. But I didn't send it to the D.T Market. Instead, I sent it to Marlon's house. By the moment it delivered successfully, I was relieved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marlon soon called me. We talked about that whether we should accept the compensation or not. Even there were a lot of arguments, but we still decided to accept the compensation. During the conversation, we discussed the risk and benefits of accepting it and not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just accepting it wasn't our final goal, and our final objective was to report it to the reporter after my dad was retired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad was a pilot at Dreamer Airline, the world's best airline company. He never spends his time playing with me because of the overwhelmed work. I was used to it already, but that day's conversation brought up the memory before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time flew by, and it came to summer break. Usually, my dad won't get back because of his busy schedule. This allowed me to enjoy my free time. Before we ended the conversation that night, he mentioned that he's coming the following day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather that day was wonderful, and I felt the same way. Around 9 AM, Marlon knocked on the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm coming!" I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, I opened up the door for him. He wore a black jacket with a Vans t-shirt for the inner. For his lower body, He wore a Gucci belt with Nike shorts and shoes. I just stood there and looked at him for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emmett, it is time to talk about some business." He said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," I realized that I gazed at him for a long time, "yeah, we can talk about some business."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, my members got some information for the situation." He said with joy on his face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to what my members said, it was the owner from D.T Market who primed the troop to get you." He continued. "We also found out that you have some relationship with the Dream Invader machine, but the data was old."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, I have a connection with the machine?" I asked him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the data, you do. But we don't know the accuracy of the data." He said calmly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If that's the case, it could explain why they want to kill me." I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You could take it as a reference, but don't take it as 100 percent accurate." He said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I heard you mentioned that it was old." I said. "May I ask you that what year exactly?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the year 2059." He said. This number was familiar to me, but I couldn't remember anything. I don't know why because I was born in the year 2075.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Got it! Thanks." I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is no other question, we will start your training. Also, we will keep investigating this problem." He said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the training, you will need to learn or practice certain skills. Exercises are also required." He continued. "Is there any question so far?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet," I said, "but I might have some in the future."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" He said. "Let us get started!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He taught me how to shoot first, but I was scared. So, he asked me to run five laps at the park, and it embarrassed me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are still scared, then run another five laps!" He said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five laps running was worse than shooting. So, I tried shooting again. It appeared to me that it's not bad, and maybe it was fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I was about to shoot again that day, someone knocked on the door.</p>
