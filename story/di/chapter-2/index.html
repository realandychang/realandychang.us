<h1 class="ac-center">Chapter 2</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the helicopter with the hourly worker, I started to panic because I know nothing about this woman in front of me. So, I said “Who are you? Why are you taking me to the D.T Market?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I guess it doesn't matter right now.” She said and then sighed. "My name is Helen White, and I am an hourly worker at your school."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason she sighed was that the females' name was something private in 2086. This suggestion was composed in the year 2076 by Rita Davis. She said this suggestion could prevent others get into females' dreams. Some people followed the direction, but most people just decided to use a fake name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as she finished answering the first question I asked, she seemed to forget the second question I asked because she worked on her phone. I knew it was not polite to look at other people's phones, so I waited. However, after 10 minutes, I asked her the question again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you taking me to the D.T Market?" I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sorry, where are we?” She asked me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I asked you that why are you taking me to the D.T Market.” I said angrily because she didn’t seem to hear what I said before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ok, be patient and I will explain everything to you.” She said. “Yesterday, after I woke you up, you ran into the forbidden area where the Dream Invader machine is. By the time you got into the machine, your profile was created. Once the profile has been created, anyone else can get into your dream easily. So, we are here to remove your profile. I am trying to save you!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you” I said. I attempted to ask more questions but the view outside soon took over my attention. This time was the first time I had ever been to San Francisco, and the Golden Gate Bridge was shiny. It soon got bored and I fell asleep. I don’t know how long I slept, but by the time I woke up, people were leaving the helicopter already. She was next to me and waiting for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realized we were still on the helicopter, so we got off using our jetpack and landed successfully. Jetpack was something new to me since it came out in the year 2081. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perfect landing Emmett!" She praised. "But I will have to go back to Los Angeles right now."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, what should I do when I am in?" I screamed to her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You will see when you got in.” She replied and then went straight to the helicopter station. I stopped thinking of her and then stepped into the market. The weather was horrible that day, so I put my hand in my pocket to keep it warm. Then, I felt something in my pocket. I took it out and it was a pack of money. My heart warmed even the weather was cold, and I thanked her in my heart for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked around the market and it was gigantic. The market had three main roads connected to the entrance and was sorted into different sections called A, B, and C sections. The section in front of me was the A section, the technology section. On my left was the B section, a section filled with illegal foods, drinks, and potions. On the other side was the C section, a section filled with organs and illegal medicines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The A section was the section I was looking for. When I saw a sign with “Dream Invader Machine Profile Removal”, I knew it was my hope. I quickly ran there and met the owner of this station, a man with fierce-looking. I was terrified, but I still asked him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I would like to remove my profile, could you please help me?” I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at me and unfolded the curtain. I waited and waited, but he did not open the curtain again. Suddenly, I saw a troop came. They had guns and grenades on their waist. Soon, I discovered they were coming for me. After I realized it was necessary to run away, they already pulled their gun out and pointed them at me. I looked at everyone surrounding me, and nobody moved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lose my hope because it was impossible to escape with so many guns pointed at me. Even after my death, people will not notice. In the year 2076, D.T Market prevented outside reporters to enter the market. Suddenly, someone carried me away from the troops, and I couldn’t remember anything else that happened that day besides the gun firing sound.</p>
