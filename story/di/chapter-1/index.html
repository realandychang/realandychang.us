<h1 class="ac-center">Chapter 1</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I woke up, I can't remember anything. My head felt empty after all, but I didn't pay any attention to it. In modern times, people always forget things every day due to the convenience of technology. I'm not an exception, and I don't want to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's weather is horrible because the clouds covered most of the sky. This weather usually means that it's going to be a cold day, but we have to go to school as usual. It usually takes 20 minutes to get to the school, so that is not so far compared to Bradly's, my best friend at school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bradly Atkinson's house is at the very north of the town, and all of the schools are situated at the very south of the town. It usually takes around one hour to get to the town. Even in the year 2086, the traffic is still horrible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At school, boys and girls can't be friends because of the battle between boys and girls. Even though I'm on the boys' side, I still hang out with Bradly. And that is one of the reasons why our classmates isolate us. However, we don't care about anyone else's opinion. That could be why we can be best friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is my first day in 6th grade, so I have to get to school at 7:30 instead of 8:05. I took a shower, washed my face, brushed my teeth, and ate breakfast. By the time I got out, it was 6:55.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the front door of the school, I saw Bradly waiting for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How's your day going, Emmett?" She said delightfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing much, just feeling a bit tired, and also something..." I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell rang, and we have to go back to our classroom usually. But today is a special day because everyone is going to be sorted into different classrooms. Unfortunately, Bradly and I got sorted into the different classrooms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first period today is technology class, which is one of my favorite courses. Today in technology, we learned more about the history of the Dream Invader machine. This machine could get into other people's dreams and hurt other people mentally and physically. Our school is the only school that has this machine for investigation purpose. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be popular, and everyone wanted to get one. However, it caused a lot of people's death. Eventually, all governments banned this machine, and nobody could get one anymore. However, this didn't help after all. So many people that purchased before began selling the machines secretly in a market. One of them even sold it out for a million dollars in the year 2056.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The platform they sell their machine is the D.T Market, a world-renowned black market. Since it is not under the governments' control, illegal trades are carried on everyday. Even it's a worldwide market, thousands of people still go to the United States, the headquarter of the D.T Market, to make a purchase or sell something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the technology class, we had lunch, and after lunch is the most boring class, Reading. As I expected, I slept during the whole class, and nobody woke me up because I had no friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, someone did. When I opened up my eyes, I saw the hourly worker in front of me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's already 10 PM, and the school is going to close soon." She said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My head became much clearer, more than usual. I don't know where to go or what to do. I'm just standing in the classroom, looking and looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't get back to the dormitory right now because It closed at 9:30, and every staff has already left the campus. Is there anywhere else I can live for a night?" I said to her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The school's nursery is still open." She said with a cold voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her voice is echoing in my head, and it sounds familiar to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stayed there for a short amount of time and then thanked her for her help. As soon as I said that, I ran away and didn't even notice where I am going. Suddenly I ran into something. I am in a house that I have never been to before, and the unfamiliar environment made me feel uncomfortable. After a while, I ran into a girl and stumbled. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was about to say sorry, but I noticed her eyes were all white with no eye-ball at all. Her looking frightened me so much. I stopped what I'm about to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, another human that ran into my dream. You are unlucky because I am the Dream Hunter." She finally says.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what you mean by that, but I think there is something you misunderstood," I said with a frightened voice. "and I can explain everything to you."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want an explanation. I want to kill you!" She said and suddenly opened her mouth. Then my eyes closed, and I can't remember anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, when I opened my eyes. I was right next to the forbidden area where they placed the machine. Everyone gathered around me and discussing me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at him! He's here when I came in!" One of them said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is disgusting! Look at the dirt on his cloth. Another one of them said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at my watch, and it is 8:00. The math class was about to start, so I rose my body and ran as fast as I could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the first period, the hourly worker came with anger on her face. "Why did you run into that machine yesterday?" She said, "Don't you know it is forbidden?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Machine? What are you talking about, madam?" I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh dear, don't you know you ran into the Dream Invader machine yesterday?" She whispered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't actually know. Also, the class is about to began in a minute." I said furiously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which do you think is more important, your own life or the class?" She said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I don't attend this class, my dad is going to limit my screen time." I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't say anything, then she dragged me and took me to the nearest helicopter station and purchased two tickets to San Francisco where the D.T Market was located.</p>
