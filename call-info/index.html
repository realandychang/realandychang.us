<p id="define"><b>How to define emergency call?</b></p>
<p>Sometimes, it is hard to define what is an emergency call. As you see in the Why section, those are defined as emergency. But, sometimes I am in school and of course school work is over anything. I will make sure to get to this problem as soon as possible, but if you think the problem will harm you in whether virtually or physically, please stop browsing!
